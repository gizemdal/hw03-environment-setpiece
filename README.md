# CIS 566 Homework 3: Environment Setpiece

Name: Gizem Dal

Pennkey: gizemdal

Live demo: https://gizemdal.github.io/hw03-environment-setpiece/

Resources:
I've mainly used the techniques discussed in the CIS566 lecture slides & Piazza, but there are a couple other outside resources I've used to implement some features and also get some inspiration. These resources include:

- Inigo Quilez's website for SDF primitives and other noise functions: https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm
- The Book of Shaders (for implementing textures & noise): https://thebookofshaders.com/11/
- Jamie Wong (for transform functions): http://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/
- ShaderToy

Project Aim:

For this project, I aimed to visualize a simple bedroom scene with a chair, a twin-size bed, a nightstand with a lamp and pictures on the wall. I wanted to have a setting where I could experiment with noise functions to create material textures and set them to several furnitures created by SDFs, so creating a bedroom setting felt like it would definitely serve the purpose. Another way I got inspired by a bedroom setting is a 3D-Modeling Environment Project I had for a class last year, where I built a replica of my college bedroom, focusing on small details of several furniture to make them accurate and life-like.
